# Logic Pro monitor level calibration project

This project file intends to help calibrating your monitor levels. I accumulated this little walkthrough by reading up on a bunch of blogposts and took what worked for me personally without really knowing if this is the way to achieve a good volume.

I welcome everybody to participate in optimizing the project file and my first draft of a guide on how to proceed.

### 1. Set monitors to lowest possible volume
If you'd like you can unmute the Pink Noise (S) track to see if you can set your monitors to output no sound at all.

### 2. Set main volume knob to your reference position
For me this would be -20dB because Apogee Control has a switch to directly jump to it. It is advisable to leave headroom to e.g. get a quieter mix at an acceptable volume or compensate when recording etc.

### 3. Set C-filter on your measurement device/app
Bring the device at height of your nose and position it at your listening position. If you are using a smartphone app, remember to let the mic point towards the center between your speaker pair.

### 4. Unmute Pink Noise (S)
Now raise the volume on your monitors slowly. You are aming for -75dB in a small room or -85dB for a large room.

### 5. Unmute Pink Noise (L) and Pink Noise (R) one after another
See if each monitor is around the same dB. It will be slightly lower than your target dB. Raise the volume of the quieter speaker to match the louder one.

### 6. Take position in your listening position and do a test drive
At this point you want to check if the reference position of your main volume knob is ok. If the volume is too loud for your ears, adjust either your volume knob reference position or the volume of your individual speakers.
